## Use Case
Take a hike is for the traveling hiker, it allows the user to search for hikes based on location and add store them to their upcoming trip.

## Initial UX


## Working Prototype


## Functionality
* When they first set up their account, users are guided through a setup process in which they will be asked to describe an achievement or success they have accomplished and to specify which skills and character traits were required in order to achieve it (for example, negotiation, interpersonal skills, planning, forethought, JavaScript, Python, classical guitar, persistence, juggling). The app will provide users with a default list of general skills and traits from which users can select all relevant ones, and (PLANNED FUTURE ADDITIONAL FEATURE) users should also be able to add and specify their own skills or traits to add to the list (for example, job-specific skills like jQuery or project management).
* Once they have initially set up an account, view their past successes in one or more graphic representations (timelines, charts, graphs, visualizations, word clouds, etc.).
